Got this from one of Guenon&#039;s books. <br>The capital of Atlantis is the Riccat structure, and northern Africa was a archipelago. It was green as well, the Sahara sands are the same sands you find deep in the sea. <br>This means there was a pole shift, and the water changed position, causing a flood in the mediterranean, while drying the atlantian sea. Remember Earth is round and hollow, and it changes magnetic dispositions each 6000 years.",
